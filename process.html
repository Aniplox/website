            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Placement Offers (PPOs):</strong> These are offers made through internships completed by students at the company.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Campus Tests:</strong> Selection through tests and interviews conducted on-campus by companies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Placement Process</h3>
            <p>The placement process follows a slot system where multiple companies may share the same time slot. Students are allowed a maximum of 55 applications before Phase 1 of the placement process, and spot-on offers or deferred selections may also be conducted depending on specific company policies.</p>
            <h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>

            <h3>Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) Policy</h3>

            <p>Students may opt for deferred placements if they are pursuing higher studies, entrepreneurship, or competitive exams like UPSC. The deferred placement must be formally requested and approved by the university.</p>
            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
