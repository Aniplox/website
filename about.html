        <h2>About Doon University</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            The Doon University, located in the lush green foothills of Shivalik, is dedicated to promoting excellence in teaching and research while offering a full range of multi-disciplinary academic programs at the undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral level. A unitary and residential university located on the outskirts of the city, it has a scenic campus with state-of-the-art infrastructure, stunning architecture, and a soothing environment.<br><br>
            Aiming at creating an autonomous and accountable institution of higher learning, the university was established by the Government of Uttarakhand by Doon University Act, 2005 (Uttaranchal Adhiniyam Sankhaya 18 of 2005) and is recognized under 12(B) of UGC Act. The spirit of the Act is to create an autonomous and accountable institution of higher learning. Accordingly, the university intends to impart socially and economically relevant education. It also aims to lead in frontier areas of research and pedagogy. Having a huge and challenging mandate, the university started its first academic session in August 2009 and has stood up to the challenges during such a relatively short period of time.

        <h2>Our History and Foundation</h2>
        <div class="timeline">
            The idea of Doon University draws its elements from the huge deficit that the state of Uttarakhand has been experiencing in the area of excellence in higher education. The Doon University Bill, 2005 (Uttaranchal Adhiniyam Sankhaya 18 of 2005) was passed by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly and assented to by the Governor on April 23, 2005. It was published in the Uttarakhand Gazette on April 26, 2005. On 9th May 2009 its statutes were approved, and the University started its first academic session on 6th August 2009.<br><br>
            The spirit of the Act is to create an autonomous and accountable institution of higher learning. Accordingly, the University intends to impart socially and economically relevant education. It also aims to lead in frontier areas of research and methods of pedagogy. Indeed, the mandate is huge and challenging.
